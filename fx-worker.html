<!--
    Declares a web worker to execute async work. Supports the following worker
    message protocol:

    {
        type: string,
        data: any,
    }

    The worker will be killed when the element is detached unless disconnect()
    is called.

    Note that all messages sent with send() expect a reply by default and will
    reject without a "timeout" error after the specified timeout unless you
    specify noreply = true.

    Usage:

    <fx-worker id="worker">
        <script type="worker">
            onmessage = function(event) {
                
            };
        </script>
    </fx-worker>

    this.$.worker.send("doWork", [stuff]).then(function() {
        // ... done.
    });
